We present a case study of using the time to recache (TTR) metric to choose which cache configuration is optimal for a given benchmark and replacement policy.
This work builds on prior work describing and implementing the TTR metric, and concludes that, while TTR can provide visualizations of cache behavior to build designer intuition into the behavior of a particular cache for a particular benchmark, the traditional method of simulating a wide variety of cache configurations to decide which is optimal is still required.

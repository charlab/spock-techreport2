\section{Conclusions}

It takes some time getting familiarized with TTR curves to figure out both how the added information from a TTR curve to makes it more useful that miss rate. 
We tried for a while to compare the curves with the ideal cache replacement strategy for a given cache configuration in hopes that the TTR would show where exactly a sub-optimal algorithm was being less effective. 
We did not have a lot of luck with this approach.

Eventually we switched to using TTR to more quickly find an optimal cache configuration as presented here, but that process ended up exhausting nearly all relative cache configurations, so there was not much savings in terms of computation time. It may be interesting to run more cache configurations to determine whether this process consistently finds the optimal cache configuration. While TTR is an interesting way to build designer intuition about cache performance, it does not significantly change traditional design methodologies or simulating a wide variety of configurations to determine which one is optimal.

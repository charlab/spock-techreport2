\section{Conclusions}

It takes some time getting familiarized with TTR curves to figure out both how the added information from a TTR curve to makes it more useful that miss rate. 
I tried for a while to compare the curves with the ideal cache replacement strategy for a given cache configuration in hopes that the TTR would show where exactly a sub-optimal algorithm was being less effective. 
I did not have a lot of luck with this approach.

Eventually I decided to switch to using TTR to more quickly find an optimal cache configuration. 

I am running more cache configurations and when they finish, I'd like to repeat this process to determine whether it consistently finds the optimal cache configuration.
